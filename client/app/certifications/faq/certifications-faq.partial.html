                    What does being "Verified" mean?

                <div class="answer">
                    Lunge takes pride in providing the public with accurate information on professionals near them.
                    Being verified means Lunge has independently verified that your certification is valid and
                    up-to-date.  Your certification status will update from "Pending" to "Verified" and that
                    information will be reflected on your profile.

                    Absolutely.  Being verified should be one of the first steps in creating a Lunge Trainer profile.
                    Users will be able to find you more easily, you will be ranked higher in search results, and you
                    will be trusted more by having the Verified (<i class="material-icons">verified_user</i>) badge on
                    your profile.

                    To receive verification, you must upload proof of your trainer certification(s).  Proof may be
                    submitted using one of the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The official organization certificate, scanned and uploaded in .pdf format
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A copy of a letter form the issuing organization containing your full name, date of issuance,
                            and date of certification expiration.
                        </li>

                    Approval can take anywhere from 1 to 10 business days depending on the certification and method of
                    verification used.

                    Once you've submitted your documents, there is no further action necessary.  Lunge will approve and

                <div class="answer">
                    There is a three document limit to each certification.  If you need to submit another file, you
                    should delete one before continuing.
