More and more evidence is emerging to show that mental flourishing improves physical health which provides the basis for health and wellness coaches helping clients envision and achieve life goals that allow them to flourish and thrive physically and mentally.\r\nThe experiential workshops provide many fun, engaging, and transformational tools and exercises that you can use in your own workshops. The training topics delivered in teleclasses and workshops cover many evidence-based domains and their translation and integration in innovative ways into coaching principles, tools, and skills. We deliver a broad and deep approach to a variety of types goals that support outgrowing of old lifestyles – including performance, skills development, behavior change, and psychological skills.\r\n\r\nWe deliver introductory training in Bob Kegan and Lisa Lahey’s “Immunity to Change” program which is an elegantly succinct model of cognitive behavioral coaching – helping coaches help clients identify and overcome “hidden” or unconscious dysfunctional patterns – allowing coaches to work with clients with challenging life situations.\r\n"
