This outstanding introduction to the field focuses on motor behavior that can be observed directly as well as the many factors that affect the quality of these performances and the ease with which they can be learned. Additionally, the text examines some of the neurological and biomechanical processes that create complex movement behaviors, reflecting the convergence toward a shared understanding of complex movement behaviors across the fields of motor behavior and motor learning, motor control, and biomechanics."

Since men and women are so fundamentally different it is not beneficial for women to follow one of current fitness models that are based on the male paradigm. The Women's Fitness Specialist Certification goes beyond this male-based system by taking in account the physical, mental, emotional, and social differences between the two sexes. This groundbreaking model will open new doors for any professional working with women in a health and fitness setting.\r\n\r\nThis extensive course will provide you with invaluable advice, information, and exercise that will be extremely useful in a wide variety of circumstances. This knowledge will provide you a platform from which you can elevate yourself far and above the realm of the \"typical\" personal trainer. If applied correctly, this course can make you extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe IFPA Women's Fitness Specialist course is designed to provide a sound, scientifically based understanding of concepts and recommendations related to training women. Typically women are given training programs that are gender based. This course will better prepare the fitness professional to design programs that not only motivate women but also take into account their physical psychological, social, and emotional differences. Secondarily, this course will examine the different stages of a woman's life, provide prescriptions and modifications for adolescents, pregnant mothers, postpartum women, and menopausal women. Finally, the Women's Fitness Certification will take an in depth look at training female athletes and preventing the female triad (Osteoporosis, eating disorders, and menopause). This course, like all IFPA courses, will raise the professional standard for the fitness industry."

The need for coaching skills is compelling given that only 20% of adults are flourishing today by two independent and validated measures. More and more evidence is emerging to show that mental flourishing improves physical health which provides the basis for health and wellness coaches helping clients envision and achieve life goals that allow them to flourish and thrive physically and mentally.\r\nThe experiential workshops provide many fun, engaging, and transformational tools and exercises that you can use in your own workshops. The training topics delivered in teleclasses and workshops cover many evidence-based domains and their translation and integration in innovative ways into coaching principles, tools, and skills. We deliver a broad and deep approach to a variety of types goals that support outgrowing of old lifestyles – including performance, skills development, behavior change, and psychological skills.\r\n\r\nWe deliver introductory training in Bob Kegan and Lisa Lahey’s “Immunity to Change” program which is an elegantly succinct model of cognitive behavioral coaching – helping coaches help clients identify and overcome “hidden” or unconscious dysfunctional patterns – allowing coaches to work with clients with challenging life situations.\r\n"
