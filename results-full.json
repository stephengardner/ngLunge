        "name": "National Council for Certified Personal Trainers (NCCPT)",
        "about": "When, where, and who started the NCCPT?  \r\n\r\nThe National Council for Certified Personal Trainers (NCCPT) was started in Southern California by John Platero in September of 1995, when he was promoted to Director of Personal Training for a chain of health clubs called LA FITNESS.\r\nFaced with the common problem of having to increase revenue without a qualified staff, John decided to create a vehicle by which he could recruit new trainers, teach them the basics and provide these future professionals with a system to earn a good living, while they continue to learn and grow as a Personal Trainer.\r\n \r\nWhere did this system come from? \r\n\r\n\r\nThis system was developed from years as a trainer and owning service-oriented businesses. After successfully owning and operating several service oriented businesses, John applied those same concepts to operating a Personal Training company. Within three months he was offered a position as District Manager for LA FITNESS and eventually promoted to a National Director of Personal Training, overseeing the entire country. \r\nJohn consulted with a variety of health care professional (exercise physiologists, nutritionists, chiropractors and trainers) and went through 34 personal training certifications from organizations such as ACSM, ACE, AFAA, ISSA, NASM, NBFE, NSCA and, most recently, the distinction of “Mastery Level” from The Resistance University.\r\n\r\nAlong with their contributions and the knowledge he obtained over 30 years of personal training experience, John constantly updates the manual and derives the curriculum from his experience and the best of all the courses he has taken. The curriculum adheres to ACSM guidelines.\r\n \r\nHow is the NCCPT different? \r\n\r\nThe NCCPT offers a different approach to the business aspect of personal training. By becoming a Premier on-line member, you can receive discounts and earn money for referring people to the site. Similar to a multi-level marketing company but without having to purchase products on a monthly basis, you will earn commissions up to four levels deep from your down-line. The NCCPT does not pretend to be the end-all of certifications, nor does it present itself as the only place to seek Personal Training information. We like to think of ourselves as a conduit of information for the Personal Trainer. \r\n\r\nWho should enroll in the NCCPT?\r\n\r\nAny person wishing to start a career as a personal trainer or anyone wanting to learn more about training. The NCCPT is a fantastic Personal Training certification with a multitude of training information. At the 2-day workshop, students receive 16 hours of personal instruction. With the in-home study course, students receive all the hands-on information on video or DVD. \r\n\r\nIs the NCCPT-CB Personal Training Certification nationally recognized?\r\n\r\nThere are several hundred certifications available in the United States. At this time there is no government agency that accredits or regulates Personal Training. For this reason, clubs and/or organizations have no legal responsibility to acknowledge or recognize any certification, unless they want to. However, this is how it works: The National Commission for Health Certifying Agencies (NCHCA) was initiated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCHCA then formed the National Organization for Competency Assurances (NOCA) to offer a membership organization in addition to the standard setting and approval functions performed by the commission. NOCA has recently changed their name to the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE).\r\nICE has member organizations that are not certifying bodies, but they do have an interest in competency assurances. Membership in ICE does not require or involve any review of certification activity, nor does the ICE involve any recognition of a discipline or profession or their certification arrangements. However, the National Commission of Certifying Agencies (NCCA) is the accreditation body of ICE. Organizations have to apply for accreditation and only those organizations that achieve this recognition are allowed to display the NCCA logo on their promotional material.\r\n\r\nNo organization may claim membership to the NCCA because the Commission is not a membership body. Remember, the NCCA is a private not-for-profit organization that does not derive any support from the federal government. The NCCA Standards do not prohibit an organization from requiring education or trainings as a prerequisite to sit for the exam. A certification organization is able to determine its own eligibility requirements for a candidate to sit for the exam, including prior educational courses, training or workshops. Additionally, the organization can offer educational materials or training programs for prospective candidates as long as the organization/agency sponsored education is not a required prerequisite to obtain the credential. Candidates should be able to use alternative education or training experience to demonstrate their eligibility to sit for the exam.\r\n\r\nThe NCCPT-CB is also an affiliate of the NBFE and is in the process of accreditation with this organization. The NBFE is modeled after the National Board of Medical Examiners.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is another organization called IDEA. IDEA is the largest continuing education provider for Personal Trainers in the world. They started the IDEA PFT-Recognition system to evaluate and verify the quality of Personal Training Certifications. The NCCPT-CB has been approved and accepted into the IDEA recognition system. \r\n\r\n  \r\nHow long is the NCCPT-CB certification valid? \r\n\r\n When you are certified through most organizations, there is an expiration date. The NCCPT-CB certification adheres to industry standard of two years. In order to maintain most certifications you must acquire continuing education units (CEUs).\r\nBy stringently reviewing all Continuing Education providers and their content, the NCCPT-CB ensures the quality of continuing education will meet the high standards required to meet the NCCPT recertification requirements.\r\n\r\nAll individuals or companies that submit courses or workshops applying to become Continuing Education Providers for the NCCPT Certified Personal Trainer to acquire CEU’s for recertification must provide extensive background information on themselves and/or their company. There submissions shall demonstrate that their content must:\r\n \r\nKeep the personal trainer’s expertise current by updating their knowledge base and teaching them new skills. \r\nBe associated with the development or comprehension of a specialty, technique, tool orexpertise in personal training.\r\nAssure the individual participating learns all of the foundational knowledge required of the minimally competent professional for this subject matter.\r\n \r\nWe feel that Continuing Education:\r\nKeeps the professional current by updating their knowledge base and teaching them new skills.\r\nFrequently is associated with the development of a specialty.\r\nMay also be based on a specific modality or tool.\r\nAssumes that the individual participating, possesses all of the foundational knowledge required of the minimally competent professional.",

Instead, it challenges students not only to grasp but also to apply the fundamental concepts of motor performance and learning to a variety of real-world settings, including teaching, coaching, the design of performer-friendly equipment and work environments, rehabilitation, and everyday motor skill learning.\r\nSignificantly updated with current research, new learning features, and more references, the fifth edition of Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis expertly combines text, figures, and practical examples to explain this complex topic in a clear and comprehensive manner. This outstanding introduction to the field focuses on motor behavior that can be observed directly as well as the many factors that affect the quality of these performances and the ease with which they can be learned. Additionally, the text examines some of the neurological and biomechanical processes that create complex movement behaviors, reflecting the convergence toward a shared understanding of complex movement behaviors across the fields of motor behavior and motor learning, motor control, and biomechanics."

The Women's Fitness Specialist Certification goes beyond this male-based system by taking in account the physical, mental, emotional, and social differences between the two sexes. This groundbreaking model will open new doors for any professional working with women in a health and fitness setting.\r\n\r\nThis extensive course will provide you with invaluable advice, information, and exercise that will be extremely useful in a wide variety of circumstances. This knowledge will provide you a platform from which you can elevate yourself far and above the realm of the \"typical\" personal trainer. If applied correctly, this course can make you extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe IFPA Women's Fitness Specialist course is designed to provide a sound, scientifically based understanding of concepts and recommendations related to training women. Typically women are given training programs that are gender based. This course will better prepare the fitness professional to design programs that not only motivate women but also take into account their physical psychological, social, and emotional differences. Secondarily, this course will examine the different stages of a woman's life, provide prescriptions and modifications for adolescents, pregnant mothers, postpartum women, and menopausal women. Finally, the Women's Fitness Certification will take an in depth look at training female athletes and preventing the female triad (Osteoporosis, eating disorders, and menopause). This course, like all IFPA courses, will raise the professional standard for the fitness industry."

        "about": "Overview\r\n\r\nFounded in 2001, the Pilates Method Alliance is the professional association and certifying agency for Pilates teachers.  For the past decade, Pilates teachers from around the world have worked together to create a unified community, to share knowledge and information, and most importantly, to establish the practice of teaching Pilates as a profession. To that end, in 2005 the PMA launched the only third-party professional certification exam in the Pilates industry. We urge you to join this movement to elevate the status of Pilates teachers and establish a new profession by becoming a PMA® Certified Pilates Teacher.\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe Pilates Method Alliance was formed in 2001 as a professional association for the Pilates community. Its purpose was to provide an international organization to connect teachers, teacher trainers, studios, and facilities dedicated to preserving and enhancing the legacy of Joseph H. Pilates and his exercise method by establishing standards, encouraging unity, and promoting professionalism.\r\n\r\nThe organization grew, and developed the first all inclusive Pilates-specific educational conference. The conference was a tremendous success and supported the unity of an industry that was rich in educators and practitioners, but extremely fragmented. Today, our community experiences greater unity, harmony and sharing than could ever have been imagined 10 years ago, and the PMA's educational conference model has been adopted by Pilates organizations around the world.\r\n\r\nThe aim of industry unification led the PMA to develop a third party professional credential (or \"certification\"), which was launched in 2005. This credential was created through consultation with a wide range of Pilates experts across the field, under the direction of professional psychometricians, and it serves the Pilates community and the public by validating that a Pilates teacher meets entry level standards for safety and competency. By establishing this professional credential, the PMA put into place one of the primary components required for any established profession.\r\n\r\nToday, the PMA is both a professional association and a certifying agency for Pilates teachers.\r\nMission\r\n\r\nThe Pilates Method Alliance (PMA) is the international, not-for-profit, professional association and certifying agency dedicated to the teachings of Joseph H. and Clara Pilates. Our mission is to foster community, integrity, and respect for diversity; establish certification and continuing education standards; and promote the Pilates method of exercise.\r\nGoals\r\n\r\n    * Establish and maintain a professional certification exam\r\n    * Encourage professional growth through continuing education\r\n    * Define the parameters of Pilates teaching and expertise\r\n    * Maintain standards while respecting the various approaches to Pilates\r\n    * Promote the benefits of Pilates exercise to the consumer public\r\n    * Serve as an information resource for all Pilates constituents\r\n    * Maintain a registry of PMA® Certified Pilates Teachers\r\n    * Maintain a registry of Pilates training organizations that includes verified information for review and comparison\r\n    * Encourage feedback and evaluate our organization to meet the needs of the community we serve\r\n",

There are no half-measures. As the term comprehensive implies, this course is NOT splintered into individual apparatus and many levels, as some programs are; it is about the whole. BASI believes that a teacher needs to be familiar with it all. \r\n\r\nThis also avoids confusion for members of the public, who often have to decide between teachers; one, say, who has graduated from level one Reformer and another who has completed a comprehensive Pilates course. They both present themselves as Pilates teachers and both have certificates of completion. But, in the eyes of BASI, there is no comparison. \r\n\r\nA CTTC graduate has both the knowledge and the accreditation to teach students of all levels on all apparatus. We do not give partial accreditation for a partial education.  It may sound severe, but it maintains the extremely high standard of our education and it avoids misinterpretation.  There is never any question about what a BASI-trained teacher is, or is not, qualified to teach.\r\n\r\nThere is also a financial dimension. With BASI you know what the cost of the course is right up front; there are no additional requirements or supplementary costs. Compare the cost of our one, comprehensive course with the cumulative costs of all the courses you have to take at other institutes to achieve a similar level of expertise. You’ll be amazed at how reasonable our price really is."

More and more evidence is emerging to show that mental flourishing improves physical health which provides the basis for health and wellness coaches helping clients envision and achieve life goals that allow them to flourish and thrive physically and mentally.\r\nThe experiential workshops provide many fun, engaging, and transformational tools and exercises that you can use in your own workshops. The training topics delivered in teleclasses and workshops cover many evidence-based domains and their translation and integration in innovative ways into coaching principles, tools, and skills. We deliver a broad and deep approach to a variety of types goals that support outgrowing of old lifestyles – including performance, skills development, behavior change, and psychological skills.\r\n\r\nWe deliver introductory training in Bob Kegan and Lisa Lahey’s “Immunity to Change” program which is an elegantly succinct model of cognitive behavioral coaching – helping coaches help clients identify and overcome “hidden” or unconscious dysfunctional patterns – allowing coaches to work with clients with challenging life situations.\r\n"

MAT™ has been successfully implemented with professional athletes (NFL, NBA, NHL, CFL, PGA, etc.) in clinical rehabilitative, personal training environments, and countless other settings.\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN MAT™ DO FOR YOU?\r\n\r\nMuscle Activation Techniques™ is a specific and unique process for evaluating an individual’s ability to produce efficient muscle contraction. Loss of muscle contraction results in a decreased range of motion, and therefore decreased physical performance.\r\n\r\nRange of motion testing can indicate which muscles have decreased contractibility, and precise forces are applied to restore that muscle’s efficiency. The MAT™ Certified Specialist is trained and certified to perform several force application techniques that can restore function and strengthen weak muscles.\r\n\r\nIn no time at all, you will be performing your daily activities with ease, whether that means throwing 100 yard passes or walking up the stairs!\r\n\r\nSEE FOR YOURSELF\r\n\r\nSee for yourself what MAT™ can do for you to decrease muscular imbalances and address muscle pain.

The Sole Synthesis Instructor training is designed to showcase the Balletone Blueprint for Success and highlight the fitness, dance/pilates and yoga pathways available.  Sole Synthesis is also a fabulous stand alone, fusion class that seamlessly blends creative movement sequences with mindful instruction for an incredible workout.\r\n\r\nThe Sole Synthesis Instructor Training will focus on how to seamlessly combine various disciplines (fitness, ballet, yoga) within one class using the fundamental teaching techniques and primary concepts of Balletone.  A basic overview of each of discipline’s unique attributes and theory will be reviewed and discussed along with how they can relate and compliment one another.  Objectives will be introduced with a theoretical approach and reinforced through practical application.  Skills and drills will allow the attendees to develop an understanding of how the educational elements of Balletone can be utilized to enhance group or one-on-one instruction regardless of the population or discipline being used.  This workshop is designed for group exercise, Pilates and Yoga instructors, and possibly personal trainers. \r\n\r\nProgram Description:\r\nWhen barefoot training meets strength, cardio and flexibility in one workout, fitness takes on a whole new meaning.  Sole Synthesis is “simplicity through triplicity” … no fancy moves here, the idea is to simply use a movement you’ve done for ages and transform it seamlessly in three different ways with ONE outcome – a proactive workout rooted in functional training that will leave you strong, centered, and actively flexible from the ground up."

Whether your interests are corrective exercise, sports conditioning, post-rehabilitation, lifestyle modification, stress management or nutrition, the C.H.E.K Institute has a program that will interest you!

This certification equips you, the movement professional, with the content, competence, and confidence to meet the needs, wants, and goals of all of your patients and clients. Unlike any other movement screen, 3DMAPS is a movement analysis and performance system that applies to the three-dimensionality and abilities of all individuals and all of human function. 3DMAPS boils down all of human movement (the three-dimensional interaction of joints, muscles, and proprioceptors) into 6 Vital Transformational Zones, adapts these movements within Mobility Analysis Movements (assessing range of motion) and Stability Analysis Movements (assessing control of motion), and empowers you to then prioritize the best and most logical progressions in serving your patients and clients better. \r\n\r\n3D … The human body moves three-dimensionally. All proprioceptors respond, all muscles react, and all joints move three-dimensionally. It only makes sense to analyze and progress the body three-dimensionally. 3DMAPS facilitates functional assessment and much, much more!\r\n\r\nMovement … 3DMAPS leverages movements – lunges, reaches, squats – that are paramount to common, everyday movements and activities. These movements are authentic to the individual and relevant to what the individual does. While other screens, scans, analyses, claim to be functional, 3DMAPS actually is.\r\n\r\nAnalysis … 3DMAPS analyzes the entire body’s mobility (flexibility, range of motion) and stability (strength, control of motion) and then identifies a Relative Success Code specific to individual – based on symmetries, asymmetries, and disabling pain within the movements.\r\n\r\nPerformance … 3DMAPS enhances the function of the individual and progresses systematically and scientifically for optimal function and improvement.\r\n\r\nSystem … Performance Movements parallel Analysis Movements, thus creating a seamless and intuitive process for both the practitioner and the patient / client.

        "about": "The National College of Exercise Professionals (NCEP) has been a leader in Fitness Industry Education and Exercise Professionals for over two decades. NCEP was born out of the original Sports Club Company in Los Angeles. Michael DeMora, the Founder and President of NCEP was a Fitness Manager for the Sports Club Company, and eventually the Director of Education for the Spectrum Clubs Company, which branched out from the Sports Club Company. Mike created NCEP from his wealth of knowledge in the Fitness Industry and from his elite education with two masters degrees.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Us Different: \r\nThere are many significant difference between the National College of Exercise Professionals and other organizations. We are a Fitness Industry Education group dedicated to the most cutting edge exercise science often known as Functional Training. The best club companies in the Fitness Industry are embracing the Functional Training approach and we truly believe that our method takes it to an even higher level. Our proprietary approach is called Athletic Performance Enhancement, and we offer a variety of certifications and continuing education workshops. NCEP is accredited by the National Exercise Therapy Association National Board of Certification, and we work primarily with high end health club companies. We are a preferred certification and education provider for the Sports Club Company (owners and operators of the Sports Club/LA clubs across the country), the Oregon Athletic Clubs (an elite club chain in the Portland area), and the Honolulu Club (the finest club in the state of Hawaii). We've also worked closely with many other top national club companies including the Spectrum Clubs, Lifetime Fitness, Golds Gym and Fitness 19.\r\n\r\nAlso, while many other certification companies are going increasingly online, we strongly believe in teaching our classes live and in person, because many people learn best with visual interaction and because fitness is a personal interaction. We maintain a low student to faculty ratio often under 15 students per class to offer a more conducive atmosphere to learn. What really makes us special is our staff dedicated to brining the students the most recent up to date infomation in an easily digestable manner.\r\nAnother aspect about our curriculum that separates us from the other certifications in the industry is that we also teach professional skills including sales, five star service, and professional etiquette. Due to our extensive work with the Sports Club Company, we are uniquely qualified as an education provider of these critical components for a successful personal training program.\r\nWe also believe in getting out into the communities and teaching our classes at the club level. Many certification companies are increasingly going on line, and while this is very convenient, it is our philosophy that the process of learning fitness is enhanced by personal interaction.\r\nWhile we are a smaller company than some of the certification mills in our industry, we are growing in our reputation and recognition. As we like to say \"We're small but we're mighty\" or as Shakespeare wrote, \"Though she be but little, she is fierce.\" We work harder and smarter than our competition and we also offer a lower price and a much better value.\r\n\r\nCourse Options: \r\nWe offer a Standard Personal Training Certification as well as numerous specialty certifications, including Advanced Program Design, Functional Assessments, Functional Anatomy, Holistic Health Practitioner, Exercise Therapist, and our MMA Trainer certification. This program combines our Personal Training certification with MMA curriculum and graduates are certified as a Personal Trainer, a Strength and Conditioning Coach for MMA, and as an MMA Trainer (or Coach) for the sport. This program has been created in conjunction with Rainbow Warrior Martial Arts and it has been endorsed by the State of Hawaii MMA Commissioner and the United States Military.",

MCT can be utilized with a wide array of clients- from the weekend warrior to the advanced athlete.\r\n\r\nMCT Programming can range from general areas of the body, to specific programming including the Ultimate 6+ areas. This can be used in conjunction with a movement assessment, or based off of specific training protocols.\r\n\r\nThis course will take you through the Ultimate 6. The Ultimate 6 are the six muscles (Soleus, Quadriceps, Psoas, Piriformis, Pectorals, Thoracic Spine) that influence biomechanics the greatest. By manipulating these six keys muscles, your body can achieve structural integrity, thus creating a platform for optimal performance and injury prevention. This course also includes what is referred to as the plus areas, the plus categories (Calf, Soleus/Calf, Anterior Tibialis, Perononeus, Inner Quad (VMO), Latissimus Dorsi) also play a major role in movement and will add to the overall effectiveness of treating the body systematically.

Through embodied anatomy exercises, you will systematically travel within your core to explore the key structures that mobilize and stabilize the spine. Using Jill's original Yoga Tune Up® techniques, you will strengthen and stretch every last muscle fiber. You will be introduced to several core-related pranayama techniques to directly experience your diaphragm and experience daily self-massage with Yoga Tune Up® therapy balls. Learn how to apply core work to your daily yoga practice, as well as ways of integrating and sequencing the exercises in a class setting. Unique empowerment exercises will address the emotional blocks that often obscure core work, so that you may uncover and resolve your third chakra issues, and ultimately inspire others."

        "about": "Alan Herdman studied at the London School of Contemporary Dance and was working as a teacher and dancer when, in the late 1960s, he was invited to New York to learn about the Joseph Pilates Method. There he worked intensively with Carola Trier and Bob Fitzgerald, two instructors who had been trained by Pilates himself. Although well-regarded amongst New York's dance fraternity, Pilates was unknown in the UK at that time and Alan returned in 1970 to set up Britain's first-ever Pilates studio. Among his first clients were actors, dancers and singers, but word soon spread as doctors and physiotherapists began recommending Pilates to patients struggling with chronic injuries.\r\n\r\nAlan now lectures on Pilates around the world, and he has written several successful books, including The Pilates Directory (2004), The Gaia Busy Person's Guide to Pilates (2003) and Pilates: Creating the Body You Want (1999). He runs a training course for Pilates instructors and, as well as running his own studios, he and his assistants teach in dance schools and designated Pilates studios internationally.",

The definition of pro: an expert that exemplifies great skill at his/her work and serves as a teacher, competitor or consultant. That definition establishes what type of individual that we are aiming to facilitate the development of through PaddleFit Pro. PaddleFit Pro is a comprehensive two day course that is going to challenge you both physically and mentally. Our goal is to have you understand and exhibit the attributes of a professional PaddleFit coach such as advanced technique, progressive training knowledge and advanced water skills. Taking what you learned in PaddleFit Core we are going to expand upon these topics and break them down to the expert level. Just like PaddleFit Core this is not going to be only a name change from Level 3. While many of the components from PaddleFit Level 3 will be included , PaddleFit Core is a full emersion into the PaddleFit system. PaddleFit Pro summary: • 2 day course • Advanced fitness and training concepts • Advanced technique teaching progression • Both days will be a mixture of interactive presentations as well as skill assessments and practical teaching sessions • Advanced physical testing and technique assessments including the PaddleFit Technique Screen™ • Course will conclude with a comprehensive written exam as well as practical skill assessment"

With complete reliance on God's Word and prayer, Holy Yoga invites us to surrender and introduces us to Grace. When we breathe and move and have our being in Christ, we find ourselves in the flow of His magnificence. There is often a misunderstanding that yoga is a religion; it is not. Yoga is a spiritual discipline, much like prayer, fasting and meditation. Yoga has the capacity to enhance our personal beliefs and faith.\r\n\r\nWe practice with our minds set on whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy (Phil 4:8), not with our minds emptied. We meditate on the wisdom of God's Word (Psalm 119:9-16, 26-27), not on man's wisdom. We seek the transcendence and glory of God, not our own.",

The Trauma-Sensitive Holy Yoga training equips instructors to walk others through physiological recovery from traumatic memories by applying different techniques to appropriately manage the symptoms of a trauma survivor. Students also study how Scripture addresses trauma and the ways in which God’s love and grace provide what is needed to safely explore the parts of the body that have felt stunted by traumatic experiences."

With complete reliance on God's Word and prayer, Holy Yoga invites us to surrender and introduces us to Grace. When we breathe and move and have our being in Christ, we find ourselves in the flow of His magnificence. There is often a misunderstanding that yoga is a religion; it is not. Yoga is a spiritual discipline, much like prayer, fasting and meditation. Yoga has the capacity to enhance our personal beliefs and faith.\r\n\r\nWe practice with our minds set on whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy (Phil 4:8), not with our minds emptied. We meditate on the wisdom of God's Word (Psalm 119:9-16, 26-27), not on man's wisdom. We seek the transcendence and glory of God, not our own.",

The Trauma-Sensitive Holy Yoga training equips instructors to walk others through physiological recovery from traumatic memories by applying different techniques to appropriately manage the symptoms of a trauma survivor. Students also study how Scripture addresses trauma and the ways in which God’s love and grace provide what is needed to safely explore the parts of the body that have felt stunted by traumatic experiences."

When we breathe and move and have our being in Christ, we find ourselves in the flow of His magnificence. There is often a misunderstanding that yoga is a religion; it is not. Yoga is a spiritual discipline, much like prayer, fasting and meditation. Yoga has the capacity to enhance our personal beliefs and faith.\r\n\r\nWe practice with our minds set on whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy (Phil 4:8), not with our minds emptied. We meditate on the wisdom of God's Word (Psalm 119:9-16, 26-27), not on man's wisdom. We seek the transcendence and glory of God, not our own.",

It provides education for understanding the effects that trauma has on the body and how the body can hold onto traumatic memories in very tangible ways. Students explore yoga postures that help facilitate healing from traumatic memories to guide students through the journey of reconnecting to the body in a safe way. The Trauma-Sensitive Holy Yoga training equips instructors to walk others through physiological recovery from traumatic memories by applying different techniques to appropriately manage the symptoms of a trauma survivor. Students also study how Scripture addresses trauma and the ways in which God’s love and grace provide what is needed to safely explore the parts of the body that have felt stunted by traumatic experiences."
